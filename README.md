# Matrix Multiple with CUDA in Python



## 00 environment set up

if you just want to use numba to accelerate your code, you can just install the numba pkgs.
But if you want to use high-api with numba in cuda, you need to install the cudatoolkit through
​        
    conda install cudatoolkit

then you can check you env. by 

    from numba import cuda

    cuda.is_available() # return the GPU available for you.
